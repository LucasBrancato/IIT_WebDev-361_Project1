  <h1><strong>My Brazilian Rock Band: "Banda do Ze"</strong></h1>
  <h2><strong>About Banda do Ze:</strong></h2>
    <h3><strong>The Begining:</strong></h3>
      <p>The band began January 2015; a past band was already formed, but since the group was having trouble to get together and to play diccent, they ended it and invited me to form another band. With me being their new drummer, things started to get little bit easier, because my house had a separeted room for my drums, so the whole band could play; also everyone got very excited since I learned songs faster then the last drummer, thus we started to play frequently every weekend, until we had a big roster of musics.</p>
    <h3><strong>Concerts:</strong></h3>
      <p>When we got really good at the songs we knew, and everyone was sincronized, we started to go after places so we could performed. Unfortunately we had a hard time finding it; so to beggin lighly playing at my sister's birthday party; than people started to recognise us, so we played in a known birthday guy's party too. And our last performance was at my 18th birthday party, which was the biggest one.</p>
    <h3><strong>Why we ended:</strong></h3>
      <p>After my birhday concert, the members spread out to other cities, because of college. So we decided to take a break from the band. Four mounths later, we ended it.</p>
